# ToDoListAngular

This project allows the user to create a list of todo's after completing each activity the user can erase elements of the list by clicking on the X right next to the item. He can drag and re organize the list by prioratizing items on the very top. If priority changes the user can drag an item to the top at any moment. 

# Sources

This project was one of the small angular tutorials available at http://yeoman.io/codelab.html . Great project to warm up and understand how the framework works. It allows the developer to understand how powerful angular can be and how the model view controller works throughout the project. 

# Added Features

I added more features to my project framework that I will develop in the future, user loging, sessions, etc. 

# Testing

I am planning on adding more tests in the future
